Hi, I’m Greg , a junior data analyst eager to turn numbers into clear, useful stories.
My current toolkit:

- SQL – writing queries for data extraction, cleaning, and summarization
- Microsoft Excel – intermediate formulas, pivot tables, basic VBA macros
- Power BI – building interactive dashboards to visualize insights

# [1.📊 Customer Segmentation with RFM (PostgreSQL + Excel)](https://www.example.com)

This project focuses on segmenting customers based on their purchasing behavior using the **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** method. The goal is to help the marketing team create more targeted and effective campaigns using data-driven insights.

## 🧰 Tools Used

- **PostgreSQL** – For cleaning the data and calculating RFM scores using SQL
- **Excel** – For building dashboards using PivotTables and charts

## 🔄 Project Workflow

1. **Data Import and Cleaning**
   - Raw transaction data was imported from [`raw_data.csv`](https://www.example.com)
   - Data was cleaned and processed using SQL: [`cleaned_data.sql`](https://www.example.com)

2. **RFM Metrics Calculation**
   - **Recency**: How recently a customer made a purchase  
   - **Frequency**: How often a customer makes purchases  
   - **Monetary**: How much the customer spends

3. **Customer Segmentation**
   Customers were grouped into:
   - **Loyal**
   - **Regular**
   - **New**
   - **Lost**

4. **Dashboard Visualization**
   - Final data was exported to Excel and visualized in a dashboard: [`rfm_dashboard.xlsx`](https://www.example.com)
